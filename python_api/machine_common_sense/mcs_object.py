    Attributes
    ----------
    uuid : string
        The unique ID of this object, used with some actions.
    color : dict
        The "r", "g", and "b" pixel values of this object in images from the MCS_Step_Output's "object_mask_list".
    direction : dict
        The normalized direction vector of "x", "y", and "z" degrees between your position and this object's.
        Use "x" and "y" as "rotation" and "horizon" params (respectively) in a "RotateLook" action to face this object.
    distance : float
        The distance along the 2-dimensional X/Z grid from you oto this object in number of steps ("Move" actions).
    held : boolean
        Whether you are holding this object.
    mass : float
        Haptic feedback.  The mass of this object.
    material_list : list of strings
        Haptic feedback.  The material(s) of this object.  See MCS_Material.
    position : dict
        The "x", "y", and "z" coordinates for the global position of the center of this object's 3D model.
    rotation : float
        This object's rotation angle in degrees.
    visible : boolean
        Whether you can see this object in your camera viewport.

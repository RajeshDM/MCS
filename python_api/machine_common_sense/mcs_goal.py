    Defines attributes of an MCS goal.

    Attributes
    ----------
    action_list : list of lists of strings, or None
        The list of actions that are available for the scene at each step (outer list index).  Each inner list item is
        a list of action strings. For example, ['MoveAhead','RotateLook,rotation=180'] restricts the actions to either
        'MoveAhead' or 'RotateLook' with the 'rotation' parameter set to 180. An action_list of None means that all
        actions are always available. An empty inner list means that all actions are available for that specific step.
    info_list : list
        The list of information for the visualization interface associated with this goal.
    last_preview_phase_step : integer
        The last step of the preview phase of this scene (scripted in its configuration), if any. Default: 0
    last_step : integer
        The last step of this scene. This scene will automatically end following this step.
    task_list : list of strings
        The list of tasks for the visualization interface associated with this goal (secondary to its types).
    type_list : list of strings
        The list of types for the visualization interface associated with this goal, including relevant core domains.
    metadata : dict
        The metadata specific to this goal.
